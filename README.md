Title: OutlivAIng_Wars
Description: 
n many war‐torn regions—such as Gaza—the human and infrastructural toll is staggering. Recent assessments suggest that in some areas up to **68% of roads are rendered unusable** due to relentless destruction. This widespread damage not only disrupts daily life by severing vital transportation links, but it also creates a profound sense of entrapment. Victims often feel as though they have reached a **dead‐end both externally—in their physical environment—and internally, as hope and pathways to safety diminish.**

Our proposed solution addresses these challenges on two critical fronts:

**Safe Navigation and Infrastructure Integration:**
We advocate for an innovative system that continuously detects and maps destroyed areas. By integrating these “no‐go” zones into platforms like Google Maps, the system prevents navigation routes from traversing hazardous, destroyed areas. This dynamic integration offers war-affected residents safe, up-to-date routing information, empowering them to relocate or access essential services with confidence.

**Digital Trauma-Focused Mental Health Support:**
Recognizing that survivors face severe psychological strain—exacerbated by degraded healthcare facilities and limited internet connectivity (often only 2G)—we propose an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework deployed on a reasoning large language model (LLM). This system is tailored to deliver **trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy** (CBT) documents and interactive support, providing continuous, accessible mental health care even in environments where traditional services are unavailable. 

These integrated approaches not only enable safer physical navigation by ensuring that maps reflect the harsh realities on the ground, but they also bolster the inner resilience of individuals by providing essential mental health resources. In conflict zones like Gaza—where residents live under dire conditions, with little clarity on safe relocation and a pervasive sense of isolation—our solution is designed to restore both mobility and hope.
